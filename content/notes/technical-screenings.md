There’s so many problems with leetcodes, but mainly in that they are gameable
and usually not representative of the work you will be doing on the job. 

I would love something that is more ability to figure out a codebase and grok it
fast to fix a bug or use it. 

Can you with outdated docs, and a messy codebase figure out what is going on and
make it pass some test cases — can this be timeboxed? 

[Gossip Glomer’s](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) and [Praetorian Tech
Challenges](https://www.praetorian.com/challenges/) are awesome, but being a
requirement can be a hassle for high value candidate

As a talented candidate and there are two companies of equal pay, and I’m not
mission driven I’ll go for the less effort one. 

CTF’s are very interesting in the security space. DevOps interviews of trying to
set up a production system and manage a database. etc.

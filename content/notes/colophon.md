> A colophon is a nobby designer word for 'how this site was made'

This site was made using the [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)
project. With theming inspired by [moonscript](https://moonscript.org) and the
[TokyoNight Theme](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme)

## Techniques

The authoring of content is done using
[LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim) on the [Warp
Terminal](https://warp.dev)


## Typography

This site primarily uses the
[Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) font for all of
it's content.

## Hosting

I use [cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) for hosting the statically built content of the site

## Growth Stages

Notes have a growth stage inspired by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/colophon) where quick and unexplored thoughts are
tagged as [[tags/seed | seed]]. More well thought notes, potentially with
sources and more structure are tagged as [[tags/budding | budding]]. 

From there notes have two different paths. Thoughts that are closer to prose and
include original thoughts are turned into [[posts]] while notes that are closer
to reference pages are tagged as [[tags/evergreen | evergreen]]. Evergreen notes
present a completed idea, but can be updated with new content. 

[tags/review | Reviews] are notes and synthesis from reading some other piece of
content. Could be a tutorial, blog posts, book, etc. These can turn into posts
as well

[tags/pattern | Patterns] are repeatable design patterns that I've found helpful
when working on projects are can be reference sheets for different tools and
platforms. These generally will also be evergreen notes.
